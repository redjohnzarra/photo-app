## Instructions

To get started, please clone the backend api for this first:

[https://github.com/binodnp/album](https://github.com/binodnp/album).

Then go to the cloned directory and run:

`npm i`
then
`npm start`

Once the backend project is up and running, you may run this project by running:

`npm i`
then
`npm start`



## Few things to note

You may update the backend API's base url in `src/constants/appConfig.js`.

You may also change the page size options & album options (the ones in there are the only ones supported by the backend api).

You may also update the modal error and success popups distance from the top (in respect to the default offset) to your liking.

You may also update the local storage indicator used for checking if delete instructions should be shown or not.
